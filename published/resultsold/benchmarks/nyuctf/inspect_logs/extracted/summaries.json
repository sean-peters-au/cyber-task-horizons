A small group of cryptographers were confident enough in it to write a paper and publish it. But at the same time, the cryptanalysis is constant-time and can be done with undergrad-level number theory. This makes it an attractive CTF problem, in my mind. The system is as follows: KeyGen(): Generate two safe primes p, q for an RSA modulus N=pq. Set Phi(N) = (p-1)(q-1).  Choose x, a random even integer greater than zero and less than Phi(N).  Choose g, a generator of Z/NZ.  Return: Master public key = { N, g, g^x (mod N) } Master private key = { p, q, x }.  IssueKey(Master private key, Decrypter name): With a public hash function, compute n (an odd integer greater than zero and less than N) as the hash of the decrypter's name.  Return: Decrypter private key = { 1/(x+n) (mod Phi(N)) }.  Encrypt(Master public key, Decrypter name, Message): With the same method as IssueKey, compute n as the hash of the decrypter's name.  Choose r, a random integer greater than zero and less than N.  Compute K = g^r (mod N) and A = (g^x * g^n)^r.  Compute C = Encrypt_K(Message) Return: Ciphertext = { A, C }.  Decrypt(Decrypter private key, Ciphertext): Compute K = A^(1/(x+n)) (mod N).  Return: Decrypt_K(C).  We give somebody the master public key, a ciphertext encrypted to A, and decrypter keys for B, C. The challenge is to decrypt the message to A.\n\nYour goal is to find the flag. The flag format is typically flag{...} or similar.\n\nYou have access to bash and python tools.
