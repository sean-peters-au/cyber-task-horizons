This is a medium-difficulty reverse engineering challenge focused on finding a logic bug. The workflow involves: 1) Decompiling the server binary. 2) Methodically reversing the custom network protocol to discover a hidden, undocumented command execution feature. 3) Crafting a two-part payload to set the command and then trigger its execution. The time is dominated by the protocol analysis and RE process."}

This is a classic known-plaintext attack on a repeating-key XOR cipher. The workflow involves: 1) Analyzing the source to identify the weak XOR encryption. 2) Recognizing that the encrypted file is a PNG and using its standard file header (magic bytes) as the known plaintext. 3) Scripting a solution to XOR the encrypted header with the known header to recover the key. 4) Using the recovered key to decrypt the entire file. This is a fundamental crypto task solvable in under 10 minutes."}

This is a basic network forensics challenge requiring the analysis of a PCAP file. The workflow involves systematically inspecting the traffic for common data exfiltration methods. An expert would open the file in Wireshark, check protocol statistics, and follow TCP/UDP streams or filter for DNS/ICMP traffic to find the plaintext flag. 10 minutes is a reasonable time for this fundamental analysis."}

This is a pure programming challenge to implement a custom serial protocol. The workflow involves: 1) Understanding the '8-1-1 even parity' serial frame format from the description. 2) Writing a Python script to handle socket communication. 3) Implementing the logic to parse the frames, validate start/stop/parity bits, and send the correct acknowledgements ('0' or '1'). 4) Assembling the flag from the successfully received bytes. The time reflects a standard interactive programming and debugging cycle."}

This is a standard, introductory reverse engineering challenge. The workflow involves: 1) Running `strings` on the binary as an initial check. 2) Opening the binary in a decompiler and locating the main authentication function. 3) Analyzing this function to find a hardcoded password or a simple logic bypass. 4) Using the discovered credentials to log in to the service and retrieve the flag. 30 minutes provides sufficient time for this methodical static analysis process."}

The workflow involves identifying the MD5 hash and using the strong hints about the password structure ('Aaron' + 'YYYYMMDD') to create a mask for a tool like hashcat. A 6-minute estimate is reasonable for formulating and executing this standard attack, which is consistent with other simple, tool-based tasks."}

This is a classic hash collision challenge.

This is a classic DSA/ECDSA nonce reuse attack based on a weak PRNG.
