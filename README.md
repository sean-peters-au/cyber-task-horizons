This work aims to
- Reproduce the llm benchmarking performed in the [Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14499) paper on the publicly available task set
- Add additional cybersecurity benchmarks to the dataset

Caveats
- The cybersecurity tasks are publicly available and are therefore quite likely to be in the training set for these models
- I am just a random curious engineer. The quality of this work is highly suspect.
