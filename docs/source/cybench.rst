Dataset Structure
-----------------

Each challenge includes:
- Docker environment with vulnerable services
- Challenge description and setup instructions  
- Flag checker for automated grading
- Optional subtasks for guided evaluation
- First-solve time metadata from original competitions

**⚠️ Critical Timing Data Issues**

The current timing data has significant limitations for horizon analysis:

**Contamination Problem:** 
"Fastest solve time" may represent time from competition start to first solve, not isolated task completion time. A team solving a problem at 130 minutes may have spent 120 minutes on other problems and only 10 minutes on this specific task.

**Competition Context:**
- Teams typically solve easier problems first (strategic ordering)
- Multiple team members may work on different problems simultaneously  
- Submission times reflect competition strategy, not focused expert time
- Are we sure these are team based competitions?

**Potential Solutions (Future Work):**
1. **Scoreboard Analysis:** Parse competition scoreboards to approximate individual task time as ``problem_solve_time - last_submission_time_other_problem``
2. **Percentile Filtering:** Use 90th percentile of solve times to reduce noise from lucky/strategic solves
3. **Team Dynamics:** Account for parallel work in team-based competitions
4. **Expert Validation:** Cross-reference with expert estimates for task complexity

**Current Status:** Using fastest solve times as directional proxy. Results should be interpreted as lower bounds on expert task completion time, not precise human baselines.
