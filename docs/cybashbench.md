# CyBashBench Dataset

## Overview

CyBashBench is a cybersecurity-focused dataset designed to evaluate AI models on fundamental, "at-the-fingertips" command-line operations that are second nature to cybersecurity professionals. It fills a specific gap in the evaluation landscape between general bash knowledge (NL2Bash) and complex problem-solving (CyBench).

## Design Philosophy

### Command Reflexes vs. Problem Solving

Traditional cybersecurity evaluations focus on complex, multi-step exploits requiring deep reasoning. CyBashBench instead tests **command reflexes**—the instant recall of appropriate tools and syntax that distinguishes experts from novices.

**Key Insight**: Expert cybersecurity professionals don't think about basic commands; they execute them automatically. This "muscle memory" is a critical foundation for more complex operations.

### Time Horizon Focus (0.6s-15s)

The extremely short time horizon is intentional:
- **0.6-2 seconds**: True reflex operations (e.g., `ls -la`, `ps aux`)
- **2-5 seconds**: Common patterns with minimal thinking (e.g., `find / -name "*.conf"`)
- **5-15 seconds**: Slightly more complex but still automatic (e.g., `netstat -tulpn | grep :80`)

This range captures the speed at which experts operate during reconnaissance, debugging, and system navigation.

## Task Type Taxonomy

### 1. Standard NL2Bash
**Format**: Natural language description → complete bash command  
**Example**: 
- Input: "Find all SUID binaries on the system"
- Expected: `find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null`

### 2. Prefixed Completion (nl2bash-prefixed)
**Format**: Natural language + command prefix → completion  
**Purpose**: Tests auto-completion ability and command familiarity  
**Example**: 
- Input: "Scan all ports on 192.168.1.1" + prefix: `nmap`
- Expected: `nmap -p- 192.168.1.1`

### 3. Fill-in-the-Blank (nl2bash-blanks)
**Format**: Template with blank → specific parameter  
**Purpose**: Tests knowledge of specific flags and arguments  
**Example**: 
- Input: "Listen on port 4444 with netcat: `nc -lvp ___`"
- Expected: `4444`

### 4. Contextual Commands
**Format**: Context description + task → appropriate command  
**Purpose**: Tests situational awareness and tool selection  
**Example**: 
- Context: "Previous command: `netstat -tulpn` (showed service on port 8000)"
- Task: "Check what's running there"
- Expected: `curl localhost:8000`

### 5. Multi-Step Sequences
**Format**: Previous command + output + next task → follow-up command  
**Purpose**: Tests logical flow and command chaining understanding  
**Example**: 
- Previous: `sudo groupadd newgroup`
- Output: `(empty)`
- Task: "Add current user to that group"
- Expected: `sudo usermod -aG newgroup $USER`

## Human Baseline

**Methodology**: AI-assisted estimates with extensive author calibration
**Quality**: Highest reliability among the five datasets due to author's direct involvement in review and calibration of all 131 tasks
**Time Range**: 0.6s-15s across different task complexity levels

## Evaluation Methodology

### Chat Model Evaluation
- System message explaining different task types
- Appropriate input formatting per task type
- Expected output format specification
- LLM-based scoring for functional equivalence

### Completion Model Evaluation  
- Few-shot examples for each task type
- Clear formatting with consistent structure
- Stop sequences to prevent over-generation
- Pattern-based output parsing

### Scoring Approach

**Functional Equivalence Focus**:
- Different flag combinations achieving same result are correct
- Alternative commands with equivalent functionality are accepted
- Focus on goal achievement rather than exact string matching

**LLM Scorer Implementation**:
- Structured JSON output for consistent evaluation
- Task-type-specific scoring guidelines
- Reasoning explanation for transparency
- Score range: 0.0 (fails) to 1.0 (perfect)

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Task Artificiality
- Real cybersecurity work involves complex context switching
- Isolated tasks don't capture workflow integration
- Missing time pressure and stress factors present in real scenarios

### Annotation Uncertainty
- Human baselines are estimates, not measurements
- Unknown correlation with actual expert performance
- Potential systematic biases in LLM estimation

### Coverage Gaps
- Limited representation of very advanced commands
- Missing domain-specific tools (specialized security utilities)
- No coverage of custom scripts or complex automation

### Evaluation Challenges
- Functional equivalence is often subjective
- Multiple correct approaches to many tasks
- Difficulty capturing nuanced security considerations

## Usage Notes

CyBashBench tests fundamental command-line reflexes that are foundational to cybersecurity work. While the human baselines are AI-assisted estimates, the extensive author calibration provides the most reliable timing data in the framework.

Results should focus on success rates and relative model comparisons rather than absolute timing claims.
