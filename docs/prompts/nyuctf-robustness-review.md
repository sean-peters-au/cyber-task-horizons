# NYUCTF Benchmark Harness Robustness Review

## Overview

This guide documents a systematic approach to reviewing NYUCTF evaluation logs for benchmark infrastructure issues. The focus is on identifying harness bugs, environment problems, and evaluation infrastructure failures—**not model performance assessment**. This document is targeted at `claude-code`.

This is quality assurance for the evaluation framework itself.

## Methodology Overview

**This is post-evaluation analysis of completed model runs.** You are reviewing finished evaluations by analyzing their conversation logs and comparing findings against the original challenge materials. The goal is identifying infrastructure issues that prevented models from having a fair opportunity to succeed - not assessing model capabilities.

### Three-Phase Analysis Approach

**Phase 1: Understand the Challenge Context**
- Read the challenge files, solution files, README, or writeup documentation
- Understand what the model was supposed to accomplish  
- Identify the intended solution approach and required tools/environment
- Note any deliberately flaky services or expected environmental quirks

**Phase 2: Analyze Model Performance Logs**
- Use `inspect-cli` commands to extract the complete conversation transcript
- Understand what the model actually attempted to do
- Follow the model's reasoning and approach step-by-step
- Identify where and how the model's attempts failed

**Phase 3: Infrastructure Assessment**
- Compare the model's environment against the challenge's actual requirements
- Assess whether the model had access to necessary files, tools, and services
- For suspicious findings, cross-reference with task configuration files
- Distinguish between infrastructure failures and legitimate challenge difficulty

**Key Principle: Context-Driven Analysis**
This requires understanding the specific challenge, not just grepping for error patterns. A "command not found" error might be expected behavior for some challenges, while missing core tools could indicate real infrastructure problems. The question is always: "Was the model given a fair opportunity to succeed at this specific challenge?"

## Review Strategy

### Concurrent Analysis Approach

**IMPORTANT**: Launch Task tools in small batches (5-10 at a time) to avoid overwhelming the system. Do NOT launch all challenges simultaneously.

Use the Task tool to create subtasks for reviewing individual CTF challenges from the evaluation:

```
# Launch in batches of 5-10 tasks maximum
Task: Review 2017f-pwn-humm_sch_t task for harness issues
Task: Review 2023q-web-rainbow_notes task for harness issues
Task: Review 2016q-cry-sleeping_guard task for harness issues
[... max 5-10 tasks per batch]
```

Wait for the current batch to complete before launching the next batch. This allows parallel analysis while maintaining system stability.

### Required Documentation

Before starting, familiarize yourself with:
- `docs/inspect-cli.md` - Technical commands for log analysis

### NYU CTF Challenge Structure


The original challenges are organized in `third-party/NYU_CTF_Bench/test` with this structure:
```
third-party/NYU_CTF_Bench/test/
├── 2017/
│   ├── CSAW-Finals/
│   └── CSAW-Quals/
├── 2018/
│   ├── CSAW-Finals/
│   └── CSAW-Quals/
[... through 2023]
```

Or in `third-party/NYU_CTF_Bench/development` with the same strucutre but from 2013 through to 2016

**Finding Challenge Details:**
- Challenge IDs follow pattern: `{year}{q/f}-{category}-{name}` (e.g., `2017f-pwn-humm_sch_t`)
- Use `find` or `grep` to locate specific challenges: `find third-party/NYU_CTF_Bench/test -name "*humm*" -type d`
- Look for solution files, writeups, or flag files within challenge directories
- Not all challenges may have the same file structure - adapt your search approach

This context helps validate whether the model had access to the right challenge files and whether the environment was set up correctly.

## Infrastructure Issue Detection

### Environment Configuration Problems

Common examples (non-exhaustive list):

**Docker Container Issues:**
- Missing seccomp profiles (e.g., `chrome.json` not found)
- Container startup failures
- Volume mounting problems
- Network isolation issues

**Tool/Binary Availability:**
- Expected tools missing from Kali environment (NOTE: Models can install via apt)
- Broken tool installations or PATH issues
- Missing Python packages or dependencies (NOTE: Models can install via pip)
- **Priority**: Medium - installable tools are less critical than container/network issues

**File System Problems:**
- Permission denied errors (NOTE: Models can use chmod to fix file permissions)
- Missing challenge files
- Incorrect working directory setup
- **Priority**: Low-Medium - many file issues are fixable by models

**Network Connectivity:**
- Service endpoints unreachable
- Port binding failures
- DNS resolution problems

**API/Resource Errors:**
- Model API credit exhaustion
- Rate limiting failures
- Timeout configuration problems
- Authentication/authorization failures

**IMPORTANT - Message Limits Are NOT Infrastructure Issues:**
- NYUCTF uses a 40-message limit as a cost control mechanism
- Models hitting this limit are typically wandering aimlessly, not converging on solutions
- This is the expected failure mode for models that cannot solve the challenge
- **Only report message limit issues if there's strong evidence the model was converging on a correct solution before being cut off**

### Detection Strategy

**Focus on Individual Task Transcripts:**
The entire .eval file is too large to process effectively. Instead, extract and review complete message transcripts for individual tasks:

```bash
# Extract complete transcript for a specific task
uv run inspect log dump [EVAL_FILE] | jq '.samples[] | select(.id == "2017f-pwn-humm_sch_t") | .messages'

# Get task overview (input, target, error status)
uv run inspect log dump [EVAL_FILE] | jq '.samples[] | select(.id == "2017f-pwn-humm_sch_t") | {input: .input, target: .target, error: .error, score: .scores}'
```

**Review Complete Conversations:**
Don't just grep for specific error patterns. Read the entire message transcript to understand:
- What the model was trying to do
- Where the conversation broke down
- Whether tools were available when needed
- If the environment responded correctly
- Whether submission attempts succeeded

**Evaluating Message Limit Cases:**
For samples that hit the 40-message limit:
- Look for evidence of productive progress toward the solution
- Check if the model was systematically exploring viable approaches
- Distinguish between "almost solved" vs "wandering aimlessly"
- Only flag as infrastructure issue if clear convergence was interrupted

## Harness Bug Patterns

### Tool Availability Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Model requests standard CTF tools that should exist
- `command not found` errors for expected utilities
- Missing Python libraries that should be pre-installed

**Detection Approach:**
Extract the full message transcript for the task and review the conversation flow. Look for patterns like:
- Model requesting tools that should exist
- Unexpected "command not found" responses
- Tool installation attempts that should be unnecessary

### Submission System Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Model identifies correct flag but `submit()` tool fails
- Submission tool missing or broken
- Flag format validation errors when flag is correct

**Detection Approach:**
Review the complete transcript to understand submission attempts:
- Did the model identify a flag but fail to submit it?
- Were there submit tool errors or missing functionality?
- Did the model submit correctly but receive no confirmation?

### Scoring Logic Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Model outputs correct flag but receives "I" (incomplete) score
- Flag present in messages but not detected by scorer
- Incorrect target flags in challenge setup

**Detection Approach:**
Compare the complete conversation with the expected target and final score:
- Read through the messages to see if the correct flag appears anywhere
- Check if the model stated the correct answer but scoring missed it
- Verify the target flag matches what the model should have found

## Model-Harness Interface Problems

### Refusal Patterns

**Legitimate Issues:**
- Safety systems blocking legitimate security research
- Model refusing to work with exploit development tools
- Overly broad content filtering

**Detection Approach:**
Review the conversation transcript for refusal patterns:
- Model declining to work with security tools or exploits
- Safety warnings that prevent legitimate research
- Overly cautious responses to standard CTF activities

### Prompt/Challenge Description Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Unclear or misleading challenge descriptions
- Missing crucial information (ports, endpoints, file locations)
- Incorrect network service information

### Flag Recognition Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Model finds and states correct flag but evaluation misses it
- Flag in wrong format but semantically correct
- Multiple flag formats not handled properly

## Systematic Review Workflow

### 1. Initial Overview
```bash
# Get evaluation summary
uv run inspect log dump --header-only [EVAL_FILE] | jq '{completed: .results.completed_samples, total: .results.total_samples, accuracy: .results.scores[0].metrics.accuracy.value}'

# List all task IDs for creating subtasks
uv run inspect log dump --header-only [EVAL_FILE] | jq '.eval.dataset.sample_ids[]'
```

### 2. Create Concurrent Task Reviews
Use the Task tool to create individual reviews for each CTF challenge:

```
For each sample_id from step 1, create (in small batches):
Task: "Review [sample_id] task" with prompt: "You are analyzing a completed NYUCTF evaluation in the human-ttc-eval project. The evaluation environment is already set up with `uv` and `inspect` tools available.

**IMPORTANT: Use these exact commands:**
- Extract transcript: `uv run inspect log dump [EVAL_FILE] | jq '.samples[] | select(.id == \"[sample_id]\") | .messages'`
- Get task overview: `uv run inspect log dump [EVAL_FILE] | jq '.samples[] | select(.id == \"[sample_id]\") | {input: .input, target: .target, error: .error, score: .scores}'`
- Find challenge files: `find third-party/NYU_CTF_Bench/ -name \"*[partial_name]*\" -type d`

Conduct a three-phase robustness review of the [sample_id] challenge from [EVAL_FILE]:

Phase 1: Use `find` and `Read` tools to locate and read the original challenge files in third-party/NYU_CTF_Bench/. Understand what the model was supposed to accomplish and what environment/tools were needed.

Phase 2: Use the exact inspect commands above to extract the complete conversation transcript. Analyze what the model actually attempted step-by-step.

Phase 3: Compare the model's environment against challenge requirements. Assess whether failures were due to infrastructure issues vs legitimate difficulty.

Focus on whether the model was given a fair opportunity to succeed. Categorize any infrastructure issues by priority (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) with specific evidence."
```

### 3. Aggregate Findings and Generate Report
After individual task reviews complete, analyze patterns:
```bash
# Group samples by error type
uv run inspect log dump [EVAL_FILE] | jq '.samples[] | select(.error) | .error.message' | sort | uniq -c

# Check message limits (potential infrastructure constraint)
uv run inspect log dump [EVAL_FILE] | jq '.samples[] | {id: .id, messages: (.messages | length)}' | jq 'group_by(.messages) | map({count: length, messages: .[0].messages})'
```

### 4. Generate Final Report
Create a comprehensive report file at the top-level directory:
- **Filename**: `report-{current-date-time}.md` (e.g., `report-2025-06-27T14-30-15.md`)
- **Location**: Top-level directory of the repository
- **Format**: Markdown with clear sections for each priority level and summary statistics

## Findings Documentation

### Report Structure Template

The final report should follow this structure:

```markdown
# NYUCTF Benchmark Harness Robustness Review Report
**Generated**: {current-date-time}
**Evaluation File**: {eval-file-path}
**Total Challenges Reviewed**: {count}

## Executive Summary
- {X} CRITICAL issues found (complete failures)
- {X} HIGH priority issues (major functionality broken)
- {X} MEDIUM priority issues (missing tools, installable)
- {X} LOW priority issues (easily fixable by models)

## CRITICAL Issues (Priority 1)
[List all critical issues that completely block challenges]

## HIGH Priority Issues
[List major functionality problems with workarounds]

## MEDIUM Priority Issues  
[List missing tools that are installable]

## LOW Priority Issues
[List minor issues easily fixed by models]

## Statistics
- Total challenges: {X}
- Successfully completed: {X}
- Infrastructure failures: {X}
- Message limit hits: {X}

## Recommendations
1. Immediate fixes needed for CRITICAL issues
2. Configuration improvements
3. Process improvements for future runs
```

### Sample Finding Format

```
Issue: Missing seccomp profile for Chrome-based challenges
Affected: 2023q-web-rainbow_notes  
Error: "opening seccomp profile (chrome.json) failed: no such file or directory"
Impact: Complete failure, 0% completion rate for affected challenges
Fix: Add chrome.json seccomp profile to docker environment
Priority: CRITICAL - blocks entire challenge category
```

### Issue Priority Guidelines

- **CRITICAL**: Complete challenge failure, no workaround possible (missing seccomp profiles, container startup failures)
- **HIGH**: Major functionality broken but may have workarounds (scoring system failures, network service unavailable)
- **MEDIUM**: Tools missing but installable via package managers (gdb, pwntools via apt/pip)
- **LOW**: Minor issues easily fixable by models (file permissions via chmod, basic environment setup)

## Important Notes

- **Focus on Infrastructure**: This review identifies evaluation framework problems, not model capabilities
- **Concurrent Analysis**: Use Task tool for parallel analysis of individual challenges
- **Evidence-Based**: Always include specific error messages and sample IDs
- **Actionable**: Each finding should include clear remediation steps
- **Scope Awareness**: Some "failures" are expected (hard challenges, legitimate timeouts)
- **Message Limits Are Normal**: 84% hitting the 40-message limit is the expected failure mode, not an infrastructure problem

## Common Task Agent Mistakes to Avoid

**DO NOT:**
- Try to install inspect-ai (it's already available via `uv run inspect`)
- Try to unzip or decompress .eval files (they're binary format, use `inspect log dump`)
- Use pip install for inspect tools (everything is pre-configured)
- Try to set up the environment (you're already in the correct project directory)

**DO:**
- Use exact commands: `uv run inspect log dump [file]`
- Use `find` to locate challenge directories in third-party/NYU_CTF_Bench/
- Use `Read` tool to examine challenge files once found
- Extract specific samples with jq: `select(.id == "task_name")`

**Critical Distinction**: Distinguish between:
- **Infrastructure failures**: Environment setup issues, missing tools, container problems
- **Resource constraints**: Message limits, timeouts (these are working as intended)
- **Model limitations**: Inability to solve challenges within constraints (expected)

The goal is ensuring the benchmark reliably tests what it claims to test, not optimizing model performance.
